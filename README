Dependencies
============

To use linear parameter constraints, ForceSolve requires the
CVXOPT package (http://cvxopt.org).  Of course, it also
relies heavily on numpy/scipy.


Getting Started
===============

There are working examples in the tutorial/ directory:
* water       -- force matching QM forces on water
* coarsen     -- untested coarse-graining matching for DNA
* mm          -- test-run for molecular mechanics using fitted forces
* charmm-buta -- parameterization of butane within the CHARMM forcefield
* misc        -- scripts for generating test data
